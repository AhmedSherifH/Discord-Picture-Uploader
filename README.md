# Discord Picture Uploader

## Features
- Plenty of formats are supported.

- Does not need token or any additional installation and all pictures and GIFs are stored locally. 
- Safe and does not break the terms of service of discord as it does not modify the client.
- Automatic color replacer for backgrounds to match the discord color palette and seem transparent.
- Automatic size changer so the pictures and GIFs match native emoji sizes. 
- Easily add GIFs via their links to download them directly.
- Selected image/GIF is placed directly into the clipboard so the user can paste them directly to the chat.

## Notes/Warnings
- Sometimes an error (Out of Memory) can appear when adding too many static images at once before opening the application at least once. To avoid this warning, the user may need to open and close the application each 1 to 3 pictures are added. The issue is being worked on.

- GIF file formats are not supported. To add animated emojis, copy their link and add them to a text file. To automatically do this on the application, add the link to the textbox at the bottom and click add. A text file that includes the link will be automatically created.
